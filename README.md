# Project 2: Greeting Card

* Author: Nathaniel Kohtz
* Class: CS121 Section X
* Semester: Spring 2016

## Overview

creates a black background with a tree with ornaments on it, with Merry Christmas text at the top, with a moon gif and a song.


## Compiling and Using


Go to a browser tab and open the index file. Program does not require user input.

## Discussion

some problems I ran into was getting the relative position to line up correctly, and getting the image to load properly, and getting things to properly appear on the screen.

## Testing

I tested it by looking at the tab with the project on it and reloading to see if the change I made did what I wanted it to do.
